    "Based on the provided text, open source refers to software with source code that is made publicly available.  This allows for collaborative development, community engagement, and contributions from multiple individuals and organizations.  Examples include Microsoft open-sourcing .NET and PowerShell, and NVIDIA open-sourcing PhysX.  Open-sourcing software can lead to improved quality, cross-platform compatibility, and increased accessibility.  There's also mention of the Open Source Definition and SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) as relevant resources.  The benefits to organizations include boosted innovation, lower hiring costs, and a more diverse and inclusive community.  However, there's also a noted lack of understanding among some organizations regarding the benefits of community engagement in open source projects.\n\nðŸ“š Sources:\nâ€¢ Open_Source_Software_Best_Practices_and_Supply_Chain_Risk_Management.pdf (p. 26, 27, 47, 50, 52, 53)\nâ€¢ clubfairbooklet_finalised.pdf (p. 28)\n"
