    "Based on the provided text, open-source software (OSS) offers several advantages.  It fosters community engagement, leading to beneficial feature development and issue resolution.  A significant portion (78% in 2022) of OSS components operate under permissive licenses, granting users considerable freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software.  The Apache License is the most popular, used by 30% of OSS projects.\n\nHowever, using OSS also presents risks.  Understanding the software supply chain is crucial for managing these risks.  A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) helps organizations identify and mitigate potential security and licensing issues, improving security and reducing costs.  Larger organizations tend to be more proactive in risk mitigation, while smaller organizations often react to issues as they arise.  The text also mentions the importance of static application security testing (SAST) for identifying vulnerabilities in the source code.  Finally, the legal aspects of OSS licensing are highlighted, with larger organizations more likely to have internal legal teams familiar with OSS licensing than smaller organizations.\n\nðŸ“š Sources:\nâ€¢ Open_Source_Software_Best_Practices_and_Supply_Chain_Risk_Management.pdf (p. 5, 19, 24, 25, 26, 31, 43, 52)\n"
